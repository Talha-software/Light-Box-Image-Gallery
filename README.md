# Lightbox Image Gallery

A simple and responsive lightbox image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and PHP. This gallery allows users to view images in a pop-up (lightbox) when clicked, enhancing the user experience by keeping them on the same page while displaying larger versions of the images.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Lightbox Effect**: Clicking an image opens it in a modal window (lightbox).
- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Images are loaded dynamically from a server-side folder or database.
- **Minimal Design**: Clean, modern, and intuitive design for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: To style the gallery and the lightbox popup.
- **PHP**: To dynamically load images from a folder or database.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For adding more advanced interactivity, such as animations within the lightbox.
